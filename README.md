## Description

Code refactoring by using semantic html elements and modifying css accordingly, in order to increase user accessibility and search engine optimization.

Semantic html elements are being used in order to reinforce the meaning of content on a web page, rather than just define its appearance. 
This helps users as well as browsers make better sense of the website's content, ensuring a better user experience for people with disabilities and increasing the usability of the website for all users.
